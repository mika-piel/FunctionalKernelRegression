This folder contains the routines and implementations needed to perform the simulation studies and apply Functional Kernel Regression to real data. <br>
The bandwidth selection methods of Rachdi & Vieu (2007), Benhenni et. al. (2007) and Chagny & Roche (2016) were implemented and can be found within this folder. 
In addition, several auxiliary functions such as kernel functions, semi-metrics and plotting routines are located here.
