This folder contains the routines and implementations needed to perform the simulation studies and apply Functional Kernel Regression to real data. <br>
The bandwidth selection methods of Rachdi et. al (2006), Benhenni et. al. (2007) and Chagny and Roche (2016) were implemented and can be found within this folder. 
In addition, several auxiliary functions such as kernel functions, semi-metrics and plotting routines are located here.
