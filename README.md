# FunctionalKernelRegression
Code for the Thesis: "Bandwidth selection in Functional Kernel Regression" <br>
Procedures for Functional Kernel Regression as well as the bandwidth selection methods of Rachdi & Vieu (2006), Benhenni et. al. (2007) and Chagny & Roche (2016) were implemented. Corresponding simulation studies and an application to real data can be found as well as all scripts for plotting the figures used in the thesis.
