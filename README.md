# FunctionalKernelRegression
Code for the Thesis: "Bandwidth selection in Functional Kernel Regression" <br>
Procedures for Functional Kernel Regression as well as the bandwidth selection methods of Rachdi et. al. (2006), Benhenni et. al. (2007) and Chagny and Roche (2016) were implemented. Corresponding simulation studies and an application to real data can be found as well.
